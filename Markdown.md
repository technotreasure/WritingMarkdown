What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

.Gists
.Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
.Files with the .md or .markdown extension

## Syntax guide
Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text file.

Headers : 
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
  
## Emphasis

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

Unordered

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

## Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

## Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
